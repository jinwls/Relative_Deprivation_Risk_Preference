# Overview

## The Association of Individual Relative Deprivaiton on Risk Preference

  Debt among young people in Korea has soared since the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggressive investment is one of the reason for the surge. The greater the social inequality, the more important the relative position and the motivation to improve one's disadvantage is put first. With asset polarization accelerating today, young people prefer alternatives that can close social gaps in a short period of time, although the risk of loss is higher than investing in safe assets with low returns. This study considers the rapidly increasing household debt and risk assets to be caused by inequality, and aims to intensively analyze the impact of social inequality on risk behavior.

### Research Question : 
    How does relative deprivation affect individual's risk preference?

### Research Goal

This notebook aims to define the reference group using demographic and geographic characteristics to measure relative position of individuals within the group, and specifically analyze the effect of relative deprivation on economic preferences(risk preference) and asset retention. Through this, we will be able to draw a conclusion on the causes and characteristics of risk behavior according to the level of relative deprivation.

### Expected Effectiveness

The core of this study is that behind the recent spread of risky asset investment among young people, there are psychological response mechanisms to inequality and active investment activities to improve unfavorable situations. This provide basic data on how individual will respond to inequality and may give more fundamental solution to consider the impact of unequal resource allocation on the economic system in establishing various government policies.
